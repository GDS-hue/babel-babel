Let those friendships breathe. Stop chasing for a while. Let the cancellations happen without internalizing them as rejections of your worth.

🔍 Invest in tiny, new directions

You don’t have to make best friends overnight. But even one new person who’s as open as you are can change your entire world.
It could start from:

A community event

A new hobby group (even online)

Volunteering somewhere

Gym, sports, music, gaming, whatever has one spark of appeal

🫶 Reconnect with yourself

Your peace shouldn’t depend on whether someone else shows up or cancels a drink.
You are bigger than your loneliness.

If you'd like, I can help with:

Ideas for low-pressure ways to meet new people

How to build a lifestyle that brings small joys

Scripts for talking honestly to your friends about how their actions make you feel
(only if you're ready for that — we don't rush).

Just say: “help me meet new people” or “help me talk to them” or even, “tell me something hopeful.”
